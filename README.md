# Simplify MLOps with PyCaret, MLflow, and DagsHub


A step-by-step data scientist’s guide to integrate MLOps in machine learning experimentation lifecycle


Introduction

The goal of Machine Learning Operations or “MLOps” is to simplify the process of deployment and monitoring of machine learning models in production. Data scientists, Machine Learning engineers, and Data engineers collaborate together to make up the MLOps function. The terms “machine learning” and “development operations,” both from the field of software engineering, are combined to form the term “MLOps.”

MLOps has the potential to include everything from the data to the models. In some cases, MLOps implementation is only used for the deployment of the machine learning models. However, in mature organizations MLOps is also implemented in a variety of other stages of the machine learning Lifecycle development such as data processing, feature engineering, experiment management, etc.




Machine Learning Problem Statement
Retaining existing customers is one of the most important key performance indicators (KPIs) for businesses that operate using a subscription-based business model. The SaaS industry is particularly difficult to compete in because customers have the freedom to select from a large number of service providers. A single negative interaction is all it takes for a consumer to decide to switch to a competitor, resulting in customer churn.

The percentage of a company’s clientele that stops purchasing the company’s goods or services during a specified period of time is referred to as “customer churn.” One method for determining a company’s churn rate is to divide the total number of customers who cancelled their subscriptions during a specific time period by the total number of subscribers who were still active at the start of the period. For instance, if you had 1000 clients at the beginning of the month and lost 50 of them, your churn rate for the month would be 5%.


Dataset
In this training, I am using a Telecom Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. You can read this dataset directly from this GitHub link. ((https://github.com/badohoun/MLoPsMlflowDagshubPycaret/tree/feature/problemstatetementsandEDA))
